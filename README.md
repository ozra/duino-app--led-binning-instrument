# Led Binning Instrument #

Measures current vs actual light output (using a shortcut current measured PV as 'sensor') of a LED by ramping the voltage from lowest to highest tolerated, while logging it. After measuring a bunch of LED's you can generate best matched serial/parallel setups for most even voltage/current/light distribution.
